 Each text that you have to 
read will be up to 900 words long, so you need to develop the ability to read quickly. 
Two key techniques that can help you do this are skimming and scanning. 
Skimming strategies 
Skimming involves running your eyes quickly over the text to find out the main ideas 
contained within it. . 
I t is useful to: 
• read th~ questions first to know what you are looking for 
• read the title of the text and any subheadings 
• read the first paragraph to see where the article is heading 
• read the first line of each subsequent paragraph 
• read the last paragraph, which may include a summary and/ or conclusion 
• see how any diagrams or pictures could relate to the article. 
While skimming, u should: 
• try to read three or four times faster than normal 
• get a good idea of what the article is about without checking new words in 
the dictionary 
• underline key words, e.g. dates, places, figures 
• focus on key words like nouns, verbs, adjectives. 
Scanning strategies 
When you look for someone's name in a telephone directory or look a word up in a 
dictionary, you don't read every line. You can scan through the text to find the 
information that you are looking for. For this to be successful, you need to know what 
you are looking for. 
---> That means you should read the question first and identify key 
    words in it to guide you. 
It is useful to: 
• read the questions so you know what you are looking for 
• find the relevant part of the text as quickly as possible 
• avoid reading the text line by line 
• avoid mouthing the words as you read 
• be aware of key words in the distractors that may also occur in the text. They may 
wrongly make you think you have the right part of the text. 
While scanning, you should: 
• look for key words in the text - nouns that reflect the questions, and words like 
problem, solution, idea, goal, improvement, danger 
• look for key words that help you interpret the text and the writer's opinion - verbs 
like must, can, hej p, ensure, increase, offir, measure, change and adjectives and adverbials like 
probably, without doubt, difinitely, possible, much worse 
• think of paraphrases for key words from the question and look for them in the text.
